         In line with our commitment to high quality customer care, Al Hekma Hospital aims to provide
        clear and transparent information to patients about all aspects of their treatment. For this
        reason, it is our policy to quote and charge separately for individual tests and procedures
        carried out in the Outpatients Department.
        Please be aware therefore that the cost of any tests or procedures, such as blood tests, scans
        and x-rays that are carried out at Al Hekma at the request of your consultant, are additional to
        the consultation fee and will be shown as separate charges in your bill. If you are in any doubt
        as to whether a test or procedure will attract a new charge, please speak to the nurse in
        advance.
        If your treatment is covered by insurance, you are advised to check with your insurance
        company before any tests or procedures are carried out.
        If you do have any questions however please speak to your nurse before procedures are carried
        out.
